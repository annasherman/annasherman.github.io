* I am a total boss
* I live with a cat who is also a **total boss.** :bowtie:
* Nobody likes kale chips.
* Everybody likes deadlifts. :muscle:

### Look at this sick code:
```Javascript
<script>
	  $("button").on("click",function(){
    	alert("Mint chocolate chip!");
    	});
</script>
```

##Project 1

###Main goals: 
* Prevent additional clicks when 2 cards are faceup
* Clear cards when matched without changing positions of other cards on the board
* Generate cards that each have a partner as well as a unique ID 
* Player switching feature
* More or less responsive board
* Ability to switch out topics

###Known bugs: 
There is a timing/delay issue which sometimes allows for 3 cards to be faceup at once. If the game is played at a normal rate (i.e. no frantic clicking), everything works fine. If clicks are too fast, some matches won't clear and some non-matches will require 3 cards to clear. 

###Future features: 
Change between 1 and 2 player mode.
Add more topic options -- content creation was not a focus of this project. 
Changing board size -- this already works (up to 6x6, limited by number of pairs in each array of topics), but still needs to be built in to the page as a user-controlled option.
